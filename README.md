# Task-Manager-
  
The code is a simple task manager that allows users to add, delete, complete, and list tasks. It uses two classes, Task and TaskManager. The Task class represents a single task, with a description, due date, and completion status. The TaskManager class manages a list of tasks.

The code starts by creating a TaskManager object. Then, it enters a loop where the user can choose from a menu of options. The options are:

Add task
Delete task
Complete task
List tasks
Quit
The user enters their choice, and the code then executes the corresponding action. For example, if the user chooses to add a task, the code prompts the user for the task description and due date, and then creates a new Task object and adds it to the list of tasks.

The code also handles invalid choices gracefully. If the user enters an invalid choice, the code prints a message and prompts the user to enter a new choice.

The code is a good example of how to use classes in Python. It also shows how to create a simple user interface with a menu of options.
